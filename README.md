The content must not overload the user and be educational. The design will ensure the site is easily navigated which will result in users returning.
</p>

### Fonts: 
* [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
<p> I chose this font for the webste as it is easily readable and compliments the color scheme and content well.
</p>

### Icons: 
<p> I have used icons from font-awsome. I used these for my social media links as they are visually appealing and simple.
</p>

### Colours:
<p> I chose the colours below because they suit the theme of the site, food and a garden. They compliment themselves, the content and the images well. The content is clearly readable and the site navigates well due to the colours. It increases the appeal of the wesbsite and UX.
</p>

* Primary Colour: #fff - White, This colour was used for the nav bar, the logo, the landing text, the fun facts texts, form text and footer icons.
* Secondary Colour #000 - Black, This colour was used for the about us text and the recipes text 
* Tertiary Colour: #4d6472 - A Blue/Grey, This colour was used for the fun facts and form background colour.
* Quaternary Colour: #9B6A6C - A Dusky Pink, This colour was used for the nav and footer background colour. It was also used under each h2.

### Images: 
<p> The images i used on the website complimented the content and the colour. The images were in contrast with the theme of food and a garden. The images were sourced from  <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">Unsplash</a> and <a href="https://pexels.com/" target="_blank">Pexels</a>, which are high quality and completely free stock photos.
</p>

### Wireframes: 
<p> The wireframes were created in <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">balsamiq</a>. This helped me to plan the visual look of the website. I created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop.

## Planning and Testing:

### Planning:
<p> The planning began by sketching the website on paper and then led to creating the wireframes. Creating the wireframes really helped me plan this project. It layed out what I wanted to achieve and you could visually see what would work and what wouldn't work.</p>

<p> I started my project by creating the nav bar and the footer. I then continued onto each section seperatly using a check list to make sure I was making progress and not vering from the overall objectives. </p>

<p> A part of my planning was using <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">coolors</a> to chose the correct colour palette.</p>

<p> I used <a href="https://w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a> to help with the basic structute of my nav and footer.</p>

<p> Planning the content prooved to be relativly easy due to my experience being gluten free myself.</p>

#### Feature Testing:

### Bugs

<p>A bug that I spent some time on and difficult to resolve was within my form. The issue was within the input fields, when google chrome would prompt auto-fill, it would impact the background colour. I spent time attempting to debug this issue in dev tools with no resolution. I began to google this issue and found a potential solution on stack overflow. The styling that was needed was,  ``` input:-webkit-autofill ``` ```` input:-webkit-autofill:hover ``` ``` input:-webkit-autofill:focus ``` this resolved the issues when setting the box shadow to transparent.</p>

<p>During the process of making this application I ran into a number of issues that proved to be very difficult for me to resolve due to me being new to html and css.</p>

<p>The first major issue I ran into was with the Recipe section. I wanted to have the section spread out into 3 div's, Ingredients, image and then the steps. I used the love running project as a base to work off and began to highly modify the code to suit my needs, but I found it extremely difficult to perfectly contain all the content. There was a lot of overflow issues. In the end after spending a lot of time on this and being unable to resolve the issue, I reverted back to 3 divs containing each element, adding a container to the 3 divs and displaying them as flex. This gave me more control although it is still not perfect or how I had envisioned it. It fits the purpose and displays the information necessary.</p>

## Know Bugs

<p> A current bug to highlight is the recipe section. It visually looks good however it is not entirely optimised. With more experience in the future I would expect it to be better. </p>
